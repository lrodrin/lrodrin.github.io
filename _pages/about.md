In 2017, I earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, UPC). During my undergraduate studies, I worked for four years in software development and developed an interest in research through my Bachelor's thesis project. In 2019, I joined the Technological Center of Telecommunications of Catalonia (Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, CTTC) as a Research Assistant. At the CTTC, I worked on international, European, and industrial research projects focused on 5G technologies. Afterwards, I pursued a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Learning and Data Science from the Menendez Pelayo International University (Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo, UIMP), organized by the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial, AEPIA).

Now, I work as Research Engineer developing bioinformatics infrastructures in the Life Sciences department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). I am pleased to work there, but I would like to have the experience of being able to do my PhD outside of Spain. I am especially attracted to NTNU's environment and excited about the opportunity to contribute to its multidisciplinary environment.

I have also been collaborating with the Computer Science department of the UPC since 2017. Our collaboration has given some scientific papers, published in books and journals and presented at some conferences.
