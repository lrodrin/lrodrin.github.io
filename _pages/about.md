In 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics Engineering with a specialization in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, UPC). However, before embarking on this exciting academic journey, my life took a completely different trajectory. I was a professional tennis player, an experience that shaped my determination and skills in competitive situations. Nevertheless, my passion for technology eventually surpassed my dedication to tennis, and I transitioned into a career in the field of computer science. During my four years as a university student, I accumulated valuable hands-on experience in software development while also nurturing a growing interest in research, catalyzed by my Bachelor’s thesis project.

Following the completion of my undergraduate studies, I embarked on a role as a Research Assistant at the Technological Center of Telecommunications of Catalonia (Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, CTTC). During my tenure at CTTC, I actively participated in international, European, and industrial research projects, all revolving around the cutting-edge realm of 5G technologies. This experience laid the foundation for my subsequent pursuit of a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Learning and Data Science, at the Menéndez Pelayo International University (Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo, UIMP). This program, orchestrated by the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial, AEPIA), further enriched my academic journey.

Between 2019 and 2023, I thrived as a Research Engineer in the Life Sciences department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). My role involved dynamic collaborations with international, European, and national centres, along with hospitals, to engineer bioinformatics infrastructures tailored for cutting-edge research in biological and medical sciences. I take immense pride in contributing to BSC's overarching mission: advancing scientific prowess and augmenting public health through innovative research endeavours and synergistic partnerships.

At present, my voyage has led me to the realm of epidemiology, where I serve as a dedicated Research Assistant at the Open University of Catalonia (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, UOC). Concurrently, I have sustained a fruitful partnership with the Computer Science Department of UPC since 2017. Our collaborative efforts have borne fruit in the form of several co-authored scientific articles, which have found their home in esteemed book chapters, and journals, and have graced the stages of diverse conferences.
