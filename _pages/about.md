In 2017, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering with a specialization in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, UPC). During my undergraduate studies, I gained four years of experience in software development and developed an interest in research through my Bachelor's thesis project. Following my undergraduate studies, I joined the Technological Center of Telecommunications of Catalonia (Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, CTTC) as a Research Assistant. At the CTTC, I worked on international, European, and industrial research projects focused on 5G technologies. Afterwards, I pursued a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Learning and Data Science from the Menendez Pelayo International University (Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo, UIMP), organized by the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (Asociación Española para la Inteligencia Artificial, AEPIA).

From 2019 to 2023, I worked as Research Engineer in the Life Sciences department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). I collaborated with international, European, and national centres and hospitals to develop bioinformatics infrastructures for research in biological and medical sciences. I am proud to participate in the BSC's mission to advance scientific knowledge and improve public health through innovative research and collaboration.

Now I work in epidemiology as a Research Assistant at the Open University of Catalonia (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, UOC). I have also been collaborating with the Computer Science department of the UPC since 2017. Our collaboration has resulted in several co-authored scientific articles, published in book chapters and magazines and presented at various conferences.
